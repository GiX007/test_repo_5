# Auto-Suggest Sample Notebooks

This repository is a sample notebook that belongs to a collection of Jupyter notebooks used in the **offline component** of the Auto-Suggest project (from the SIGMOD 2020 paper *Learning to Recommend Data Preparation Steps Using Data Science Notebooks*).  

The notebooks here serve as test cases for:
- **Crawling and downloading** from GitHub  
- **Replaying and execution tracing**  
- **Processing operator sequences** for analysis  

They are not intended as standalone projects but as supporting material for building and validating the Auto-Suggest pipeline.
